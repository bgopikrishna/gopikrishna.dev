# How I Use AI in My Day-to-Day Work

I’ve been using AI tools daily in my workflow, and over time I figured out a pattern that works for me. It’s not about letting AI do everything, but about using it to save time and stay focused on the important parts.

### General Research with ChatGPT

For research, I mostly use ChatGPT. Things like:

* Finding the right docs or examples
* Summarizing long documentation
* Comparing different approaches before picking one

It saves me from digging through multiple tabs and StackOverflow threads.

### Implementing Features with Cursor

When it comes to building features, I rely on Cursor. My flow usually looks like this:

1. **Understand the codebase** – If I’m new to a flow, I first use Cursor’s research to go through the code and figure out what’s happening.
2. **Write it down** – I’ll create some notes, update docs, and usually make flow diagrams so I (and others) understand what’s going on.
3. **Technical Decision Doc** – Before coding, I prepare a short doc about what I’m going to build, options considered, and why I picked one approach.
4. **Review with peers** – Share the doc, get feedback, tweak it.
5. **Agent mode** – Once the doc is final, I use Cursor’s agent mode to start implementing. But this part needs handholding — you can’t just let AI write the whole thing. I keep checking, correcting, and adjusting the code. AI helps, but you still need to get your hands dirty.

### PR Review with CodeRabbit

After raising a PR, I usually run an **L1 review with CodeRabbit**. Since it has Jira context, it actually knows what feature I was working on, which makes the feedback more relevant. After that, it goes to peers for final review.

### Lessons Learned

* AI speeds things up, but only if you drive the process.
* You can’t trust AI blindly — it *will* hallucinate sometimes.
* Writing down technical decisions upfront makes everything smoother.
* AI + peer reviews together work better than just one of them.
* At the end of the day, you’re still responsible for correctness.

This is the way I use AI day to day. It’s not “AI building stuff for me” — it’s more like having an assistant who helps me think faster, write docs quicker, and code with fewer blockers.
