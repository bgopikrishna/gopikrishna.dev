I always had a slight confusion between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript.

Now, Let's dive into the topic.

When we declare a variable without assigning any value to it, **its value will be `undefined` by default.**

```js
let color;
console.log(color); //undefined
```

> When we assign `null` to a variable, we are explicitly assigning a "nothing" or "empty" value to it.

For example, we have a `userDetails` the variable that stores the details of a user. At first, it doesn't have any data, so we are assigning `null` to it.

```js
let userDetails = null;
```

Later we assign the `userDetails` variable with the response from our function `getUserDetails`. The function may be a call to an API or accessing `localStorage` for details etc. Here it's just a simple function that returns an object.

```js
function getUserDetails() {
  return {
    userName: 'gk',
    id: '1',
  };
}

userDetails = getUserDetails();
console.log(userDetails); // {userName:"gk", id:"1"}
```

If the value is unknown at the time of variable definition, it's always best to use `null`.

Thank you.
