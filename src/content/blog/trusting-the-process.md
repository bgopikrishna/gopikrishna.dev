Lately, Iâ€™ve been thinking about how life never quite goes as planned. You set goals, map things out, and then boom, everything shifts. Itâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing, just a reminder that control is often an illusion. But that doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re powerless.

I came across a line in **The Stormlight Archive** that really stuck with me

> The first step to being in control was to see yourself as capable of being in control - Jasnah Kholin (Stromlight Archive #3)

That shift in mindset changes everything. Uncertainty isnâ€™t about being lost, I think itâ€™s about adopting to changes. Things wonâ€™t always go the way you expect, but that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t shape your own path.

And when things feel unfair, thereâ€™s another perspective, just because you donâ€™t see balance right away doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not there. Doing the right thing might not always make life easier, but thatâ€™s not the point. Often, that struggle and hard work will lead you to something greater, and we just might not see it yet.

So hereâ€™s to trusting the process. To taking small steps even when the destination isnâ€™t clear. 
Journey before destination, IFKYK ;)
